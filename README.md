A zero configuration web service that holds recent status updates from my servers.

It has a single web page that lists servers, gives me a link to their SSH port and indicates if a server isn't running anymore.

Agent installation:

```
curl -sL https://raw.github.com/nictuku/myservers/master/agent/install.sh | bash -x
```
